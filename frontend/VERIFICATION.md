- [x] App renders with the dark emerald palette, radial pools, and subtle cyan/pink blends.
- [x] Noise overlay is visible at ~20% opacity and can be tuned via utility classes.
- [x] LiquidHero panel displays gradient headline and frosted shell without layout regressions.
- [x] Dashboard tiles now consume `GlassCard`, maintaining legible titles and long copy.
- [x] Primary/secondary buttons plus inputs expose AA-compliant hover/focus states.
- [x] Manual contrast audit shows body text on surfaces at ≥ AA; primary bumped via HSL tokens where needed.
- [x] Prefers-reduced-motion removes transitions/animations via global media query.
- [x] `npm run build` (vite) completes successfully for regression coverage.
